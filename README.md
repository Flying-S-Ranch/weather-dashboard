# WEATHER DASHBOARD

## DESCRIPTION
This project draws weather information from an API and displays the forecast for a selected city. This project allowed me to practice connecting to third-party APIs, and to continue practicing skills across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## USAGE
To begin, search for a city in the search bar on the upper left-hand corner. Click the search button and the current weather will appear on the right, with a five day forecast below. The city you have searched for will be stored in a list under the search button. These list items are also buttons so that users can easily access the weather and forecast for their favorite places.

## CREDITS
This project drew its basic design from the README in our bootcamp assignment. The layout is adapted from the sample project.

I made use of the Materialize CSS framework. The link to access this framework is available here: https://materializecss.com/

The Full Stack blog entry titled "How to Use API Keys" was very helpful for this project. This blog entry can be accessed here: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys

I found the formula to convert Kelvin temperatures to Farenheit here: https://www.google.com/search?q=kelvin+to+fahrenheit&oq=kelvin+to+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i433i512l2j0i512l7.3501j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
